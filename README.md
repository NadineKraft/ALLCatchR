# ALLCatchR

_The gene expression classifier ALLCatchR identifies B-precursor ALL subtypes and underlying developmental trajectories_

_ALLCatchR_ was developed to predict:
- 21 BCP-ALL molecular subtypes (BCL2/MYC, CDX2/UBTF, CEBP, DUX4, ETV6::RUNX1, ETV6::RUNX1-like, HLF, Hyperdiploid, iAMP21, IKZF1 N159Y, KMT2A, Low hypodiploid, MEF2D, Near haploid, NUTM1 PAX5 P80R, PAX5alt, Ph-like, Ph-pos, TCF3::PBX1, ZNF384)
- Associations to B lymphopoiesis stages based on gene set enrichment analyses 
- Blast Count percentage
- Immunophenotype
- Patient's sex
